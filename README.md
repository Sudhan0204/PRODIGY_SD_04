# Sudoku Solver in Java 🧩

This repository contains a Java-based Sudoku Solver that uses the **backtracking algorithm** to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles efficiently. The algorithm fills empty cells in the puzzle by testing valid numbers, backtracking when a conflict arises.

## Features
- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- Implemented using the backtracking algorithm.
- Easy to understand and modify for different grid sizes.
  
## How It Works
The program checks the puzzle row by row, trying to place numbers (1-9) in empty cells. If a conflict is found, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This continues until the puzzle is solved or no solution exists.
